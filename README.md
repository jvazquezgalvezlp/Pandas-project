## Shark Attack 

I have the hypothesis that USA suffers the most shark attacks in the world because they have a greater density of white sharks in their coasts and I also believe that most attacks will have happened to men since I believe that men are way more unlucky than women.
The following response to my hypothesis wil be based on a dataset about shark attacks from Kaggle. The order that I am going to follow will be: 

1st IÂ´m going to find out the most affected countries in the dataset.
2nd I will divide accidents by gender.
3rd I will look for the most dangerous shark species.
4th I will try to find out where this species attacks the most.
